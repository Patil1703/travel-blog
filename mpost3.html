            <h2>Shillong</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Shillong is known as the Scotland of the East, a dreamy hill station in Meghalaya, and a lesser 
                    known gem of India’s wild and unspoilt Northeast region. Meghalaya literally translates to the 
                    abode of clouds. Morning mists, scented pine forests, and rushing waterfalls add to the romantic 
                    appeal of this green, picturesque location.</p>

                <p>Shillong is situated at the centre of an elevated plateau in the midst of the rolling Khasi 
                    Hills, at an average altitude of 1500 metres. Nowadays, Shillong town has a typical urban 
                    sprawl that comes hand in hand with new development. However, certain pockets of the city exude 
                    the nostalgic charm of old Catholic Churches, bungalows from the Victorian era and rambling 
                    golf courses. </p>
                
                <p>Shillong enjoys a temperate climate — quite different from the rest of tropical India. Summer 
                    temperatures are never extreme.  The rainy season, extending from June to September, is prone 
                    to rain and drizzle. But if you are willing to embrace the monsoon magic, Shillong in the mists 
                    has a beauty all its own.</p>
                    <img src="shillong.jpg" alt="Shillong" width="100%"> 
                <p>There are many places of scenic beauty scattered in and around town. Crystal clear lakes, 
                    cascading waterfalls, and opportunities for kayaking and caving will add to the thrill factor 
                    of a trip to Shillong. Head to Umiam Lake, 17 kilometres out of town, to experience a serene, 
                    tranquil atmosphere with boating and picnicking opportunities. Shillong Peak provides a good 
                    vantage point to take in the beautiful views of town and the surrounding hilly terrain. Elephant 
                    Falls, Sweet Falls, and Spread Eagle Falls are a treat to behold and their cascading waters 
                    provide good photo opportunities. </p>
                
                <p>The people of Shillong are very warm and welcoming. They embrace a more westernised culture 
                    and outlook, which may in part have been influenced by local missionary activities in the 
                    region. The local Khasi, Jaintia, and Garo people have long inhabited the Shillong region 
                    and interestingly have their own matrilineal society, native food, and culture. </p>
                
                <p>To visit Shillong, is to escape into an alternative reality in India — reality that will often 
                    catch you by surprise and remind you of the West. However, dig deep below the surface of the 
                    local culture and you will discover customs, food, and a way of life that are unique and 
                    delightful.
