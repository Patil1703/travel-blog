            <h2>Uttarakhand</h2>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Kumaon is a hilly region of the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand. The name Kumaon 
                conjures up vivid images of tranquil hill stations, mountain lakes, towering Himalayan 
                peaks, and thick forests that are the preserve of the majestic Bengal tiger.</p>
            <p>Kumaon is much loved for providing many pristine trekking, hiking, rafting, and 
                boating opportunities. The best times to visit are either before or after the 
                monsoon, when the weather is at its best and provides heavenly conditions to enjoy 
                such outdoor activities.</p>
                <img src="uttarkhand.cms" alt="uttarkhand" width="100%"> 
            <p>The peaceful hill stations of Ranikhet, Almora, and Nainital are tiny jewels studded 
                in Kumaon’s crown. Nainital is the largest town in Kumaon and was developed by the 
                British into their summer playground. With scenes reminiscent of the English Lake District,
                 boating clubs and charming villas set around Naini Lake abound here. Other gifts of the 
                 Kumaoni landscape are hikes that culminate in spectacular scenery and nature walks in 
                 forests of oak, pine, and deodar. Peaches, apricots, apples, and plums are some examples 
                 of the bounty accorded to the region.</p>
            <p>The Kumaon Himalayan range towers above the hill stations. These constitute some of the highest 
                peaks of the Himalayas, with multiple peaks exceeding 5,500 metres in altitude. Most majestic 
                of these peaks is Nanda Devi with its distinctive two-peaked massif, encircled by 12 other 
                lofty peaks.</p>
                <img src="uttarkhand1.avif" alt="uttarkhand" width="100%"> 
            <p>For adventurous travellers, the fairly accessible Pindari Glacier Trek allows passage through 
                virgin countryside on the edge of Nanda Devi National Park, although the Milam Glacier Trek 
                to the east of Nanda Devi is reputed to be more of challenge.</p>
            <p>Lastly, we come to one of the most famous attributes of Kumaon. The mystique and thrill of the 
                region were popularized through the incredible writing of Jim Corbett, particularly his 
                bestselling book Man Eaters of Kumaon. Jim Corbett National Park, named after the great 
                man himself, was the original site of Project Tiger, a conservation project aimed at reviving 
                dwindling tiger numbers. Although the first part of Jim Corbett’s career targeted the killing 
                of tigers that had an appetite for human subjects, the latter part of his career was centred 
                around tiger conservation efforts. </p>
            <p>When you visit Kumaon, revel in the keen sense of adventure of a tiger trail. Alternatively, 
                trek to dizzying heights to drink in some of the most spectacular stretches of mountain scenery 
                in the world. Either way, you most certainly won’t be disappointed. Here are the Top 10 reasons 
                to visit the Himalayas.</p>
